# AWS IAM Policy Data Tracking

This repo fetches, parses, and then stores historical changes to the data contained on the [AWS
IAM policy generator service](https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html).

There are several iterations of this on GitHub that I have seen, but none of them are updated
on a regular basis, nor do they contain all of the different data available through the policy
generator.
